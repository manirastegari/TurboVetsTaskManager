# TurboVets Task Management System

A secure task management system built with NX monorepo, featuring role-based access control (RBAC) and JWT authentication.

## Architecture Overview

This project uses an NX monorepo structure with the following components:

### Apps
- **`apps/api`** - NestJS backend API with TypeORM and SQLite
- **`apps/dashboard`** - Angular frontend with TailwindCSS

### Libraries
- **`libs/data`** - Shared TypeScript interfaces and DTOs
- **`libs/auth`** - RBAC logic and JWT authentication utilities

## Project Structure

```
TurboVetsTaskManager/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/                 # NestJS Backend
│   └── dashboard/           # Angular Frontend
├── libs/
│   ├── data/               # Shared Data Models
│   └── auth/               # Authentication & RBAC
├── package.json
├── nx.json
└── tsconfig.base.json
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
# Start backend API
nx serve api

# Start frontend dashboard
nx serve dashboard
```

## Data Models

### User
- Basic user information with role-based access
- Roles: Owner, Admin, Viewer
- Organization-based hierarchy

### Organization
- 2-level hierarchy support
- Parent-child organization relationships

### Task
- Task management with status, priority, and categories
- Organization-scoped access control
- Assignment and due date support

### Audit Log
- Track all user actions and access
- Security and compliance logging

## Access Control Design

The system implements a comprehensive RBAC system:

- **Owner**: Full access to organization resources
- **Admin**: Manage tasks and users within organization
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to organization resources

All access is scoped to the user's organization with proper permission checks.

## Next Steps

This is Stage 1 of the implementation. Future stages will include:
- Backend API implementation with authentication
- Frontend dashboard with task management
- Advanced RBAC features and testing
- Documentation and deployment setup

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro#learn-nx?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
