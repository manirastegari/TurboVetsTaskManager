### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeORM, SQLite, JWT, Bcrypt
- **Frontend**: Angular 20, Standalone Components, Custom CSS
- **Database**: SQLite with TypeORM entities
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Testing**: Jest for backend, Karma/Jasmine for frontend
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier permission system
- **Organization Scoping**: Data isolation between organizations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete action tracking

### RBAC System
| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access to organization resources |
| **Admin** | Task management, limited user management |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to assigned resources |

### Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection protection via TypeORM
- XSS protection via Angular sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Security headers in production

## 📊 Data Models

### Core Entities
- **User**: Authentication and profile information
- **Organization**: 2-level hierarchy support
- **Task**: Task management with status, priority, categories
- **AuditLog**: Complete action tracking

### Relationships
- Users belong to Organizations
- Tasks are scoped to Organizations
- Audit logs track all user actions
- Parent-child organization relationships

## 🚀 Key Features

### Backend API
- RESTful API with comprehensive endpoints
- JWT authentication middleware
- RBAC guards and decorators
- Database seeding with test data
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging for all actions

### Frontend Dashboard
- Modern Angular standalone components

- Role-based access testing
- Form validation testing

## 📈 Performance & Scalability

### Current Implementation
- SQLite for development and small deployments
- TypeORM for database abstraction
- JWT for stateless authentication
- Angular standalone components for tree-shaking
- Docker for containerization

### Scalability Considerations
- Database connection pooling ready
- Microservices architecture compatible
- Redis caching integration points
- Load balancer support
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
